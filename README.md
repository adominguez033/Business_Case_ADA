## Introduction

This repo contains the Business Case - Business Analyst Health QC.


## Objective:
Given tw different tables (customer orders and items in the darkstore), the aim is to come up with different recommendations in order to grow the SuperGlovo business.
The aim is to propose different actions in order to increase the conversion rate, the average size order and the product margin.

## Process:

1. **EDA - Explanatory Data Analysis** 
Using Python, null values detection was done, as well as data type identification. Also, different columns were created: revenue, product margin, time of the day, etc.

1. **KPIs determination**
Once data was clean, KPIs were identified: average order size, average product margin, among others. See point 3 in this report.

1. **Tables relationship establishment**
Using SQL, relationship between the two tables was established in order to link them through a query.

1. **Insights identification**
Several calculations using Python and Excel were done in order to identify different insights to address the objectives.


See final report, in which recommendations are included, as well as assumtions taken during the project and next steps.
